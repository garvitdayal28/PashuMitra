Project Understanding: BreedLens - Cattle and Buffalo Breed Identification for BPA

Problem:
- The Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA) faces issues with incorrect identification of cattle and buffalo breeds
- Field Level Workers (FLWs) struggle with accurate breed identification despite training
- Misclassification affects data integrity for research, policy planning, and interventions

Solution Approach:
1. Build an AI-driven breed identification system using image recognition
2. Create a user-friendly interface for FLWs with minimal technical training requirements
3. Develop a system that can handle diverse environmental backgrounds, lighting conditions, and animal poses
4. Maintain a database of Indian cattle and buffalo breeds and their crosses
5. Design an interface that can be integrated with BPA platform

Project Structure:
- Clean folder structure with separate components for different functionalities
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Files limited to 100-150 lines of code for maintainability
- Focus first on UI development, then AI integration later
- Component-based architecture for better debugging

Key Features to Implement:
1. User authentication for FLWs
2. Dashboard for quick access to main functions
3. Camera/Image upload interface
4. Breed identification results display
5. History of past identifications
6. Settings for app preferences
7. Analytics for identification statistics
8. Integration capabilities with BPA

Initially focusing on building the UI components while maintaining a clean architecture that will be ready for AI integration later.
